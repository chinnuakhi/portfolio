# portfolio
This Portfolio project is about different kinds of birds and special things about them.
I have designed this in a way that there are number of images of birds and you can see the name of the bird below that and if u click that name you will be redirected to page containing clear and complete details about the specific bird.
I have designed this using HTML and CSS.
Here in this project HTML is used to design a webpage about birds and CSS is used to make the webpage look better and enhanced.
All the CSS styling is present inside the HTML head part style tag.
All the details about birds is present in the body part of HTML.
I have used a number of style tags like font-style,font-family,etc...to give better look for text.
I also used colors,background-colors,font sizes,border-radius,width,height etc..to give better look for web page.
This program can be run by cloning or downloading and open the html page using a webbrowser.
